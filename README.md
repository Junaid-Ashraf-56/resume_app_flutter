## Chalenge(s)
 - Pixel overflow when the project text is long.
 - Solution: I wrapped the text widget with a 'flexible' widget so that it moves to the next line when it reaches the end of the screen.

## Libraries used
### Iconsax icons
This library was used because it provides a beatiful icon pack that makes the ui of the app visually pleasing.
