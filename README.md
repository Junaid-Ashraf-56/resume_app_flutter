# Resume App

## Description
This is a resume app built using Flutter.

## Features
 - View Image, name, position and bio
 - View social media handles by clicking on the links
 - View projects/portfolio
 - Download Resume (UI only)
 - Toggle between light and darkmode manually
 
## Code base
This app is built with flutter which uses a single dart codebase that allows it to run on both android and ios devices.

## Design
The design is built to allow users use the app easily. The design is accessible and usable and follows crucial rules of design.

## Features I'd  love to add
 - Automatic light and dark theme switching
 - Automatic language switching
 - Resume download functionality
 - Ability to communicate (chat/call) within the app

## Chalenge(s)
 - Pixel overflow when the project text is long
  Solution: I wrapped the text widget with a container so that it moves to the next line when it reaches the end of the screen.
